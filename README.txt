Notes for Grader:
For this milestone, we have created the basics when it comes to initial UI. Both perspective mode and general perspective mode work, and the program can take in .txt files as well. We've hardcoded some inputs in as well as a file input, the program will work with any correct file input and will change into perspective mode if prompted. The main bug is that button's layer over eachother, ie we haven't figured out how to change stages or clear certain details of a button press.
